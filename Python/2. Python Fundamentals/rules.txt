Rules for Naming Python Variables
1. Constant and variable names should have a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_). For example:

snake_case
MACRO_CASE
camelCase
CapWords
2. Create a name that makes sense. For example, vowel makes more sense than v.

3. If you want to create a variable name having two words, use underscore to separate them. For example:

my_name
current_salary
5. Python is case-sensitive. So num and Num are different variables. For example,

var num = 5 
var Num = 55
print(num) # 5
print(Num) # 55
6. Avoid using keywords like if, True, class, etc. as variable names.
